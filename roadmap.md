# ROADMAP.md: Snake Game with Two Snakes - Future Development

This document outlines the planned features and improvements for the "Snake Game with Two Snakes and Extra Features" project. The goal is to build upon the existing feature-rich foundation to enhance gameplay versatility, visual appeal, fun, and long-term engagement.

**Status Key:** `[ ]` = Not Started, `[x]` = Completed

## Guiding Principles

*   **Fun Factor:** Prioritize features that make the core gameplay loop more engaging and exciting.
*   **Versatility & Replayability:** Offer diverse ways to play, customize, and challenge oneself.
*   **Polish & Presentation:** Improve visual and audio feedback for a more professional and immersive experience.
*   **Performance:** Ensure new features are implemented efficiently, especially considering mobile compatibility.
*   **Maintainability:** Keep the codebase organized and scalable.

## Phased Approach

Development will proceed in phases, allowing for incremental releases and focused testing.

    *   `[ ]` Implement a system to select predefined color schemes or simple patterns for player and AI snakes.
    *   `[ ]` Store selection in `localStorage`.
*   **[Gameplay] New Power-Ups (Selection):**
    *   `[ ]` Introduce 2-3 new power-ups from the suggested list (e.g., *Freeze Opponent/Cannon*, *Magnet* for food).
    *   `[ ]` Ensure distinct visuals and clear `applyEffect` logic.
*   **[Meta] Achievements System (Basic):**
    *   `[ ]` Implement tracking for 5-10 simple achievements (e.g., "Score 100 points," "Eat 5 Super Foods," "Win a game").

    *   `[ ]` Implement optional swipe controls as an alternative to buttons.
    *   `[ ]` Add a dedicated on-screen "Pause" button for mobile.
*   **[UX] Difficulty Presets:**
    *   `[ ]` Offer "Easy," "Medium," "Hard" presets that adjust AI speed, game speed, and obstacle count.
    *   `[ ]` Keep custom settings available.
*   **[UX] Minor UI Tweaks:**
    *   `[ ]` Refine button styles and layout for better consistency.

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay Expansion (Target: v1.2)

**Goal:** Introduce more significant ways to play and interact, adding depth and replayability within the existing game structure.

*   **[Gameplay] Local Player vs. Player Mode:**
    *   `[ ]` Allow two players on the same machine using different key sets (e.g., WASD vs. Arrows).
    *   `[ ]` Adjust UI to show scores clearly for both human players.
*   **[Gameplay] Dynamic Arenas (Selection):**
    *   `[ ]` Introduce 2-3 basic arena types (e.g., "Classic Open," "Maze Lite" with a few static walls, "Hazard Zone" with simple periodic traps).
    *   `[ ]` Allow selection before starting a game.
    *   `[ ]` Modify obstacle/collision logic to handle static elements.
*   **[AI] Improved AI Behavior (Basic):**
    *   `[ ]` Implement basic pathfinding (e.g., A* or greedy best-first search) to navigate around obstacles/other snake more effectively.
    *   `[ ]` Add simple risk assessment (e.g., avoid shrink food if short, prioritize high-value items).
    *   `[ ]` Make AI difficulty selectable (linked to presets or separate).
*   **[Meta] Statistics & High Score Table (Local):**
    *   `[ ]` Track and display basic post-game stats (score, food eaten, time played).
    *   `[ ]` Implement a local high score table using `localStorage`, perhaps filterable by mode/settings.
*   **[Gameplay] More Food Types:**
    *   `[ ]` Introduce 1-2 new food types (e.g., *Poison Food* to avoid, *Speed Boost Food*).
*   **[Visuals] Theming System (Basic):**
    *   `[ ]` Develop a basic system to switch between 2-3 visual themes (e.g., "Classic," "Neon") affecting colors, background, and potentially element styles.
    *   `[ ]` Build upon the skin system from Phase 1.

### Phase 3: Major Features & Online (Target: v1.3+)

**Goal:** Implement larger, potentially more complex features that significantly expand the game's scope.

*   **[Gameplay] Online Multiplayer (PvP):**
    *   `[ ]` Implement real-time online multiplayer using WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO).
    *   `[ ]` Requires backend infrastructure for matchmaking and game state synchronization.
    *   `[ ]` Include online leaderboards.
*   **[Gameplay] Campaign Mode (Initial Chapters):**
    *   `[ ]` Design and implement the first set of campaign levels with increasing difficulty and unique objectives/modifiers per level.

*   **[Gameplay] Boss Battles (First Boss):**
    *   `[ ]` Design and implement a first boss encounter (e.g., enhanced "Mega Cannon" or "Obstacle King Snake").
    *   `[ ]` Trigger based on score or campaign progression.
*   **[Visuals] Advanced Skins & Theming:**
    *   `[ ]` Expand the range of skins and themes, potentially with unlock mechanisms tied to achievements or campaign progress.
    *   `[ ]` Allow more complex patterns or visual effects for skins.
*   **[AI] Advanced AI Personalities:**

    *   `[ ]` Implement a system offering regular challenges with specific goals and rewards.
    *   `[ ]` Requires a mechanism to generate/distribute challenges (can be client-side seeded initially).
*   **[Meta] Replay System:**
    *   `[ ]` Implement functionality to record and playback game sessions.
*   **[Content] More Content:**
    *   `[ ]` Continuously add more levels, arenas, skins, power-ups, food types, bosses, and achievements based on popularity and feedback.
*   **[Balancing] Game Balancing:**
    *   `[ ]` Actively monitor and adjust game speed scaling, power-up frequency/effects, scoring, AI difficulty, and collision penalties based on player feedback.
*   **[Performance] Continued Optimization:**
    *   `[ ]` Profile and optimize performance bottlenecks as new features are added.
*   **[Community] Community Features (if online):**
    *   `[ ]` Consider features like friends lists, spectating, or custom lobbies if online multiplayer becomes popular.

### Technical Considerations (Cross-Phase)

*   **Performance:** Monitor frame rates and resource usage, especially on mobile. Optimize rendering, collision checks, and AI calculations. Limit particle effects or pop-ups if needed.
*   **Balancing:** Continuously test and tweak new mechanics to ensure fairness and fun. Gather player feedback.
*   **UI/UX:** Ensure the interface remains clean and intuitive as new options and modes are added. Update settings menus accordingly.
*   **Storage:** Utilize `localStorage` effectively for client-side data. Plan for backend storage if online features (multiplayer, global leaderboards) are implemented.
*   **Testing:** Rigorously test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, various mobile resolutions) for compatibility and responsiveness. Test touch controls thoroughly.
*   **Code Quality:** Maintain modularity (classes), minimize global scope where possible, use constants for magic numbers, and keep documentation (comments, this roadmap) updated.
